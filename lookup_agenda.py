#lookup_agenda.py
#This program finds agenda sessions in the data you imported.

#To complete this task, you will need to:
#1. Parse command line arguments to retrieve lookup conditions
#2. Get the table records which match the lookup conditions provided
##3. Print the resulting records onto the screen

#We should be able to run your program as follows:\
#`$> ./lookup_agenda.py column value`
